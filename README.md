# Personal blog

This repository contains the source content for my personal blog, which lives on
https://brendan.abolivier.bzh.

All content is written in Markdown, and is then turned into static pages with
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using [my own
fork](https://github.com/babolivier/hyde) of [the Hyde
theme](https://github.com/spf13/hyde).
